            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>AS the <hi>firſt Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>October</hi> the laſt, was uſhered into the World by a frightful <hi>Blazing Comet,</hi> ſo their <hi>ſecond Conjunction</hi> is attended with the two formidable <hi>Eclipſes</hi> of the two great <hi>Luminaries</hi> of the <hi>Heavens.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> going before it, upon the 17th of this preſent <hi>January;</hi> and the ſecond of the <hi>Moon</hi> coming after it, upon the firſt of <hi>February</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Inſomuch that this middle Conjunction (ſeeing theſe two ſuperior Planets will again have their third and laſt Conjunction upon the ſecond of <hi>May</hi> next) is made the more Illuſtrious by a double <hi>Deliquium,</hi> or ECLIPSE of both the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> within a few days of <hi>it,</hi> before and after, it happening betwixt the twentieth and thirtieth of this <hi>January.</hi> All which have this ſtrange concurrency, to render this preſent Conjunction the more conſpicuous, and to be of greater Obſervation and Authority to its Spectators.</p>
            <p>I have early and late taken my ſtricteſt <hi>Proſpect</hi> of the <hi>Progreſs</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</hi> that theſe two <hi>great Planets</hi> have made ſince their laſt <hi>October Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction;</hi> and I have obſerved they have been running Retrograde, untill at length they came into an equal diſtance each from other, and from the <hi>Lions Heart</hi> in a direct line, ſo that then theſe three <hi>great Stars</hi> in this poſture and ſituation did repreſent the exact Form of <hi>Orions Girdle</hi> (which the vulgar call the <hi>Ladys Yard-wand</hi>) <hi>bright Jupiter</hi> being the middle Nail, <hi>Cor Leonis</hi> and <hi>ſullen Saturn</hi> were the two end-Nails of that Coeleſtial Yard-ſtaff. Then <hi>Jupiter</hi> marcheth off from his middle Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a farther diſtance from that fixed Star the <hi>Lions Heart,</hi> and the two wandering Stars <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> make a nearer approach each to other all <hi>December</hi> laſt, and all this <hi>January</hi> hitherto: I have beheld every clear Evening, theſe two Planets ariſing in a perpendicular poſture, but in the Morning towards their ſetting, they have a traverſe Aſpect, running near the ſame line in the Heavens, where famous <hi>Arcturus</hi> runneth, and
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:109679:3"/>every Night, they come nearer and nearer each other, until they ſhall within a few days compleat their <hi>ſecond Conjunction,</hi> which will happen near the ſame time that the two great Luminaries (the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi>) ſhall have their <hi>compleat Conjunction</hi> alſo, ſo that the Body of the <hi>Moon</hi> interpoſeth it ſelf betwixt our Sight and the <hi>Sun,</hi> and cover its Light and Luſtre from us full nine Digits: yea, and the <hi>Moon</hi> ſhall be Eclipſed by the Interpoſition of the <hi>ſhadow of the Earth</hi> ſoon after it; and that which makes all this ſtill more Marvelous, is, theſe three admirable <hi>Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> (of the two ſuperior Planets, of the two great <hi>Luminaries,</hi> and of the <hi>Moon</hi> with the <hi>Earths ſhadow</hi>) ſhall be all almoſt in <hi>Direct Oppoſition</hi> one to another.</p>
            <p>All theſe prodigious Providences, thus admirably concurring at one Juncture of time, do ſound a loud ALARM to us, to ponder both the <hi>Premiſes</hi> and the <hi>Conſequences</hi> in our Minds, until they have a kindly Influence upon our Affections: To omit the <hi>Planets Conjunction</hi> upon which I am after ſo Copious, the Theme I here Handle is the <hi>Eclipſes,</hi> which puts the World upon a Gaze: The Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> in the <hi>old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and our <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>new,</hi> foretold of ſtrange and ſtupendious <hi>Eclipſes</hi> ſhould be fore-runners of the Lords coming. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, both the Goſpels and the Epiſtles in the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> do foreſhew that there will be prodigious events and appearances both in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> on the <hi>Earth</hi> and in the <hi>Sea. Luke</hi> 21.25. and that the whole frame of the univerſe ſhall ſhake and tremble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Houſes, when ready to Fall, give ſome great Cracks to fore ſignify it. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of the Sun at Chriſts Death, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.45. was certainly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural. For (1.) It was at <hi>Full Moon</hi> upon the fourteenth day of the Moons Age at the Paſs-over, whereas natural and ordinary <hi>Eclipſes</hi> of the Sun are always at New Moon in Conjunction with it and not in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it. 2. That Darkneſs by a Total <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> continued [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] over all the Earth from the ſixth hour to the ninth: which could not be natural, for the Body of the Sun being bigger than the Body of the Moon, doth ſoon wade from under its ſhadow, and never continueth totally darkned for one hour much leſs for three. (3.) That <hi>Eclipſe</hi> was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, which no <hi>natural</hi> can be, being always particular to thoſe Provinces which have the nigheſt propinquity to the Cone of that ſhadow; whereas this was not in <hi>Judaea</hi> onely (as <hi>Origen</hi> miſtakes) but <hi>Tiberius</hi> ('tis ſaid) was ſenſible of it at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Writes to <hi>Policarp,</hi> That they had this Darkneſs in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and he was ſo aſtoniſh'd at this Complication of many Miracles in one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he cryed out <hi>[Naturae patitur Deus aut na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura periclum]</hi> either <hi>Nature now determineth,</hi> or <hi>the God of Nature now ſuffereth.</hi> This dreadfdl <hi>Eclipſe</hi> happened under the fift Climacterical
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109679:3"/>Conjunction of the two ſame Superior Planets ſince the Creation, wherein the Sun hid his Head (as it were) in a black Mantle, as aſhamed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thoſe ſhameleſs Indignities done to the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> (Mal. 4.2.) by the <hi>Sons of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next formidable <hi>Eclipſe</hi> we read of in Hiſtory, is under the ſixt <hi>Great Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> 800 years after this, upon the approaching Death of that famous Emperor <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> who dyed on the fift of the <hi>Kalends</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 814. Whereof <hi>Eginardus,</hi> writing that Emperours Life, ſaith thus <hi>[Signa multa praeceſſerunt mortem glorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi &amp; Sancti Imper. Caroli, nam Eclipſis ſolis &amp; Lunae; ultra ſolitum fuit. Apparuit per ſeptem Dies macula Nigri Coloris in ſole.]</hi> Many ſtrange Prodigies did preceed this <hi>Great Charles</hi>'s Death, as <hi>Eclipſes</hi> extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both of the <hi>Sun</hi> and of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and a great back Spot was beheld in the Sun for ſeven days; which could not be <hi>Mercury</hi> (as ſome ſaid) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his ſwift Motion; nor could it be a <hi>Meteor</hi> (as others affirm'd) becauſe that is too high a place for theſe Exhalations, according to the known Rules of Phyloſophy. It muſt therefore be <hi>[Digitus Dei]</hi> the <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God,</hi> pointing at that great Providence, which removed the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or impediment which had thitherto hindred the further and fuller <hi>Revelation of the Man of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Artiſts have held Eclipſes to be the moſt precious Treaſure of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology and Chronology, giving the certain and indubitable Characters of Time, as alſo that they have an irreſiſtible Influence upon <hi>Countries, Cities</hi> and <hi>Inhabitants</hi> that lay under the Line of them. Thus mighty remarks have been upon them in all Ages, both before and after Chriſt. As (1.) <hi>Plutarch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Varro</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> obſerve, that there was an <hi>Eclipſe of the ſun</hi> at <hi>Romulus</hi>'s Birth, who was the firſt founder of <hi>Rome</hi> in the year of the World 3180. and <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, There was another <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe</hi> of the Sun at <hi>Romnius</hi>'s Death in the year of the World 3235. and may not we hope, that theſe Eclipſes now may Prognoſticate, that God will <hi>Reckon with Rome,</hi> and Eclipſe her Glory, that the Vials of Gods Wrath ſhall be ſhortly poured down upon her, for her ſo long filling the <hi>Church with Hereſy,</hi> all <hi>States with Blood,</hi> evil Men with Plots, Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Treaſons, but good Men with a due ſenſe of the many Holy <hi>Cheats,</hi> of that ill Infalible <hi>Chair.</hi> I omit thoſe <hi>Eclipſes</hi> that Fore-ran <hi>Xerxes:</hi> over-running <hi>Greece</hi> in the year 3469. mentioned by <hi>Herodotus:</hi> that which portended the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi> Warr, recited by <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides;</hi> That of <hi>Great Alexander</hi> routing <hi>Darius, &amp;c.</hi> and that of the Fall of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and many other portentous ones.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) All along ſince Chriſt, great remarks have attended them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that afore-mention'd in the 8th Century, before great <hi>Charles</hi> his
<pb facs="tcp:109679:4"/>Fall: in the 11th Century ſo great an <hi>Eclipſe of the Sun</hi> hapned at Noon, that the very Stars were ſeen in the Heavens, and then did the Sun of the glorious Goſpel ſet at Noon upon the poor <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who were univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally Maſſacred by the <hi>cruel Croiſadoes</hi> of the Roman Beaſt. Yet God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd an <hi>Holy Remnant</hi> for <hi>Royal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe:</hi> but thoſe that fall out near <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macterical Conjunctions</hi> (as is afore hinted) are moſt formidable, as was that in 1652. which wanted not its direful Conſequences and Confuſions.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Inhabitants of <hi>China</hi> (who think themſelves to have two Eyes, but other people of the World to have but one) are much affrighted with <hi>Eclipſes.</hi> Looking upon the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> as Man and Wife, and that they are angry with them under theſe <hi>Deliquiums. &amp;c.</hi>
